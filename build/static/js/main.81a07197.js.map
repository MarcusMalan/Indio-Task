into gestures like\n\t * panning or scrolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n\t * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n\t * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n\t *\n\t *```javascript\n\t *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n\t *    constructor(props) {\n\t *      super(props);\n\t *      this.state = {\n\t *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n\t *      };\n\t *    }\n\t *    componentDidMount() {\n\t *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n\t *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n\t *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n\t *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n\t *    }\n\t *    render() {\n\t *      return (\n\t *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n\t *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n\t *          {this.props.children}\n\t *        </Animated.View>\n\t *      );\n\t *    }\n\t *  }\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n\t * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n\t * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n\t * the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to\n\t * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n\t * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n\t *\n\t * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n\t * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n\t * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n\t *\n\t * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n\t * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n\t * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n\t * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n\t * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n\t *\n\t * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n\t * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n\t * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n\t *\n\t *```javascript\n\t *  style={{\n\t *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n\t *    transform: [{\n\t *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n\t *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n\t *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n\t *      }),\n\t *    }],\n\t *  }}>\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n\t * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n\t * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n\t *\n\t * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n\t * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n\t * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n\t *\n\t * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n\t * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](docs/animations.html).\n\t *\n\t * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n\t * can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n\t * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n\t * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n\t * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n\t * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n\t * implications in the future.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports={\n\t/**\n\t   * Standard value class for driving animations.

about event ordering in the `EventPluginHub`.\n\t *\n\t * Suppose plugins are injected in the following order:\n\t *\n\t * `[R, S, C]`\n\t *\n\t * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n\t * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n\t *\n\t * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n\t *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n\t *   `extractEvents()`.\n\t * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n\t *   dispatched events\".\n\t * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n\t *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n\t * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n\t *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n\t *   name deferred).\n\t *\n\t * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n\t * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n\t * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n\t * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n\t * in the first place.\n\t *\n\t * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n\t *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n\t * - They should not have side effects.\n\t * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n\t *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n\t *   extraction.\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n\t *\n\t * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n\t * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n\t * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n\t * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t *\n\t * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n\t * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n\t * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n\t * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n\t * will appear as follows:\n\t *\n\t * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n\t * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t */\n\t\n\tfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n\t  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === 'topSelectionChange' ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\t\n\t  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n\t  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\t\n\t  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n\t  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

* Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated`\n * library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and\n * maintain.\n *\n * The simplest workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n * panning or scrolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n *    constructor(props) {\n *      super(props);\n *      this.state = {\n *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n *      };\n *    }\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n *    }\n *    render() {\n *      return (\n *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n *          {this.props.children}\n *        </Animated.View>\n *      );\n *    }\n *  }\n *```\n *\n * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n * the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to\n * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n *\n * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n *\n * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n *\n * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  style={{\n *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n *    transform: [{\n *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n *      }),\n *    }],\n *  }}>\n *```\n *\n * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n *\n * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n *\n * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](docs/animations.html).\n *\n * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n * can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n * implications in the future.\n */\nmodule.exports={\n/**\n   * Standard value class for driving animations.

order:\n *\n * `[R, S, C]`\n *\n * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n *   `extractEvents()`.\n * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n *   dispatched events\".\n * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n */\n\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === 'topSelectionChange' ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\n  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.
